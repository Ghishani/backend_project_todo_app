# HomeChamp To-Do List
#### To do or not to do, that is the task!

### Intro

This API provides a to-do list for occupants of a household. Tasks are created for a household which can be assigned to a user within the household to be completed. Each member of a household has a preference of category in which various tasks fall under; users will be able to be assigned tasks according to their preferred categories. Categories include *shopping, cleaning, cooking*.
